## What is Visual Dynamics?
A web application made in Python with Flask that aims to automatize molecular dynamics generation and execution with GROMACS.

GROMACS can be a little hard to learn and use at times, so we provide each user the ability to not care about GROMACS commands and instead just about their molecule and ligand files.
