Before the setup you should read [how to prepare a gmail account](https://labioquim.github.io/visualdynamics/setup/automated-emails)

The process to setup Visual Dynamics is pretty straightforward, where you can either:
- Clone the repository/download a release .zip, extract and run `./run -i`
or
- Run this `source <(curl -s -L https://bit.ly/vdinstall)` on a terminal.

The process is as clear as we could make it be.
