Jmol building notes

Building Jmol properly requires three projects:

Jmol
JSmol
JSpecView

- JSpecView: Jmol needs JSpecView's jar file, so if there are changes, to JSpecView, start there.
  The build.xml in JSpecView will copy files to Jmol (to appletfiles/ and jars/).

- Jmol: update org.jmol.viewer.Jmol.properties and check it in so that it gets a new time stamp.
        Jmol.properties is also used by JSmol (along with all the Jmol java files).

- JSmol: run:

			 build_11_fromjmol.xml
			 build_12_fromjspecview.xml
			 build_13_tojs.xml
			              
         Test test test!  (jsmol.htm, simple2.htm, supersimple.htm)
	     
- JSmol: Update and check in jsmol files

- Jmol: run buildjsmolzip.xml

- Jmol: Update and check in jmol files


# Developers: to add a description of changes you have made,
#  add it on a line below the "Jmol.___JmolVersion=..." line.
#  Don't use Jmol.___ in your text, as that is the key for stripping out
#  the information saved in the JAR version of this file.
#  The quotes above	 look odd for a parameter file, but they are 
#  important for the JavaScript version of Jmol.
#
# A full Jmol/JSpecView/JSmol release requires the following:
#
# 1. Generate a new version number. This should be done as in the following examples, 
#    listed in order of appearance:
#
#    previous     new
#
#    14.8.10  14.8.11-beta-2016-12-20 a beta release of 14.8.11 with a timestamp for Dec 20, 2016
#    14.8.10  14.8.11                 bug fixes only - patch level
#    14.8.10  14.9.0                  new features - minor version level (tag for Maven, create branch)
#    14.8.10  15.0.0                  new features - major version level (tag for Maven, create branch)
#
#  The distinction between major and minor is arbitrary.
#
#  Note that -beta releases will be to https://sourceforge.net/projects/jmol/files/Jmol-beta
#  while full releases will be to https://sourceforge.net/projects/jmol/files/Jmol.
#
# 2. Create a new Jmol.___... line and remove "Jmol.___" from the line for the
#    previous release; failure to do remove this line will use the original release number, 
#    not the new one, since this is a property file.
#
# 3. Commit this change.
#
# 4. Run jmol buildmin.xml, signing the jar files only
#
# 5. Run jsmol build_11_fromJmol.xml
#
# 6. Run jsmol build_12_fromJSpecView.xml
#
# 7. Refresh the JSmol project
#
# 8. Run jsmol build_13_tojs.xml
#
# 9. Run jmol builddist.xml
#
# 10. Run jmol/tools build-release.xml
#
