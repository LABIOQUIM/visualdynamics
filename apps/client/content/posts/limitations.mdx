There are some limitations in place, either purposely defined or that we couldn't solve yet.

Here's the ones we know of:

### Simulations

- Molecule files must not contain more than 10000 atoms. The simulation will error on purpose.
- Simulations of structures with multiple chains work, but generate unproductive analyzes (RMSD, RMSF, RG and SASA). We are working on this automation.

### System

- In the same way that we make the application available openly and free of charge, we reserve the right to cancel, restart, and/or completely delete any simulation, at any time when such action is necessary without prior notice.
- Be aware that only one account/user is allowed per person. Failure to comply can lead to account/user suspension without prior notice.
- To recover simulations from the previous server (until June 7th), you must write to [fernando.zanchi@fiocruz.br](mailto:fernando.zanchi@fiocruz.br) with your username.
