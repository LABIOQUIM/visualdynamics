# Simulation

- The simulation generation and execution process has been updated to use shell commands exclusively, such as `gromacs` commands and file manipulation with tools like `cat` and `sed`. This change has also helped reduce the codebase by consolidating the models under a single executor.

- All three simulation models available can now be fully replicated manually using commands generated by Visual Dynamics.

# Execution

- An Execution Queue has been implemented using Celery, which allows running three simulations simultaneously with 10 cores each.

- By running simulations in parallel instead of sharing all cores among all simulations, the execution time is expected to be faster.

- Users can still request the execution of a simulation at any time. If the queue has an available slot, the simulation will start immediately. Otherwise, it will wait for a slot to open, and the queue will automatically pick up the next job. Email notifications will be sent in case of errors or successful completion.

- There are plans to explore the possibility of decentralizing the processing to further optimize the execution.

# Webpage and Server
- The user facing webpage has been reworked to a more modern and dashboard-like appearance

- The back-end code has been updated to be responsible of handling data only, not webpage views

# What's next?
There are more features and improvements that the team has stored for the next version. As always, Visual Dynamics keeps open source ([available here](https://github.com/LABIOQUIM/visualdynamics)) and free for anyone.
